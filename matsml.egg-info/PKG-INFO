matsml

Matsml is a comprehensive machine learning toolkit designed for materials science applications. It provides a set of powerful tools for data analysis, model development, and the discovery of novel materials using machine learning techniques.

Dependencies
To use matsml, the following packages are required:
 - NumPy: https://numpy.org/
 - Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
 - Scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
 - Keras: https://keras.io/
 - TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/
 - TensorFlow Probability: https://www.tensorflow.org/probability
 - ASE: https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/
 - Dscribe: https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest/index.html
 - Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/

Installation
To install matsml and its dependencies, follow the steps below:

Ensure that you have the latest version of pip, setuptools, and wheel:
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel


Install the core dependencies:
    pip install "numpy>=1.18" "pandas>=1.0" "scikit-learn>=0.22" "scipy>=1.1.0"
